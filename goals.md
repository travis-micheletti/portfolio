<!-- MVP GOALS! -->
-Have a home greeting page
    -small picture of myself
    -abstract/modern imagery in background
    -my name, developing software engineer
    -short brand statement
-From home Be able to navigate to:
        -bio
        -resume
        -projects
        -links(social media, GitHub, etc.)
            -these can be on the nav section that appears on all pages
-Use JavaScript to create 3 points of interaction
    -I'd like my bio, resume and projects buttons to "navigate to a new page" via DOM manipulation while keeping it a single page application
    -On my bio page I'd like a mouseover feature for "extra information" like hobbies, sports teams, video games, etc
    -have home page/nav items change styles upon mouseover for pleasing transition
    <!-- The above is subject to change but initial ideas for 3 interaction points -->
-Be a responsive design
    -Design for mobile first!
    -have media queries set to adjust elements/styling if on larger devices


<!-- STRETCH GOALS! -->
<!-- BRONZE -->
-add more CSS styling past functionality standpoint
-add desired transitions for javascript interactions
-add/integrate current/past projects versus having placeholders
-setup a direct contact page where a form will submit communication to my email
<!-- SILVER -->
-add something simple and interactive to an area
    -first(only) idea for now is a reaction speed test
        -have blank space
        -prompt to wait for red dot and then click
            -randomness aspect of red dot appearing between x and y ms
        -start timer once red dot is shown
        -display in ms to .000 place how much time elapsed
            -look into having a high score/scoreboard where people can leave their names and it records speed and date
    
<!-- GOLD -->
-time permitted, find a way to on a single page set up a mandelbrot set (or fibonacci sequence as i assume this will be much easier) graph? some sort of art generation with a function or algorithm 
-possibly even design home page abstract imagery(doubtful)
-have every interaction/navigation between pages have enjoyable but minimalistic transitions
-for the projects/games have a selectable tab for friends/family, colleagues, potential employers
    -for friends/family, no code is shown?
        -if any code, very very very basics
    -for colleagues, core elements of code is shown
    -for employers, in-depth code with comments to show thought process available/accessable on each element
